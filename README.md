# Jumbotail-POC
A proof of concept for monitoring an asset (trucks, salespersons) while they are making a trip. This was developed as a part of Crio.Do developer program as proof-of-concept for the organization Jumbotail.

## Overview 

This POC was made for a Crio.Do developer program for a Bangalore based company named Jumbotail. This project includes the implementation of the functional requirements mentioned during the hackathon,
and it also contains one additional requirement that we have implemented. Here is a list:

- Querying for an asset between a given time interval, displaying its spatial co-ordinates in the map, chronologically.
- Querying for all assets between a time interval.
- As an addition, a "distance-to-destination" vs "time" graph has also been implemented, so as to analyze the trips taken by an asset. This can be used for further analysis, using sophisticated methods.
